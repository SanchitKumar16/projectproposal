<mark>Project Proposal: NFT creation</mark>

Sanchit Kumar

What?

Creating a program which modifys png photos, which can be later minted into NFTs. Using this code I want to add attributes, rarity, and other key factors to make unique 
NFTs that can be later used for gaming purposes. 


Why?

In todays day, there is a growing interest in NFT art and applications that utlize NFTs. This program will allow you to modify png photos and allow you to add different layers to create unique art without having to draw or make the art yourself. This sort of program would make it easier to create NFT based characters for something like and NFT trading card and battling game. 


For Whom?

This program could be for people that want to just create their own NFT collections to sell on places like "Opeansea" or it can also be utlized by game developers who want a 
relatively quick and easy way to create unique computer genrerated art for their games. 


How?

Will create a node js application with a user interface where you will be able to upload layered pngs and adjust weights of certain attributes. This allows you to control NFT variation along with being able to introduce rarity. 



Scope

I will have a UI that will allow me to maniuplate the creation of these NFTs and will be able to display these images on the frontend. The backend will store the images 
so that they can be retrived later.
